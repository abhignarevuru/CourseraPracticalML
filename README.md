Practical ML | Data Science Specialisation | Johns Hopkins | Coursera

The Weight Lifting Exercises (WLE) dataset (Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013) was used for this project under its Creative Commons (BY-SA) license.

The goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
